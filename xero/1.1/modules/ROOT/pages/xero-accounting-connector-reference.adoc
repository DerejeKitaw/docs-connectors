[[RepeatableFileStoreStream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

File store repeatable streams require buffering, and there are different buffering strategies. Mule keeps a portion of contents in memory. If the stream contents are larger than the configured buffer size, Mule backs up the buffer’s content to disk and then clears the memory.

See xref:mule-runtime::streaming-about.adoc[Streaming in Mule Apps].

[[RepeatableInMemoryIterable]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Iterable

This configuration, which is the default for the Mule Kernel, configures a default buffer size of 500 Objects. If the query result is larger than that, the buffer expands to a default increment size of 100 objects until it reaches the configured maximum buffer size. If the stream exceeds this limit, the app fails.

See xref:mule-runtime::streaming-about.adoc[Streaming in Mule Apps].

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | The number of instances to initially keep in memory to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can fit into this buffer, then the buffer expands according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. Default value is 100 instances. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised when the buffer gets full. Default value is 100 instances. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | The maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value lower than or equal to zero means no limit. |  |
|===

[[RepeatableFileStoreIterable]]
=== Repeatable File Store Iterable

This configuration is the default for Mule Enterprise Edition. This strategy uses a default configured in-memory buffer of 500 objects. If your query returns more results than the buffer size, Mule serializes those objects and writes them to your disk.

See xref:mule-runtime::streaming-about.adoc[Streaming in Mule Apps].

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required

| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which maxInMemorySize is expressed |  |
