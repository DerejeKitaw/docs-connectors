[[GetFileVersionLegalHolds]]
== List file version legal holds
`<box:get-file-version-legal-holds>`


Get a list of file versions on legal hold for a legal hold assignment. Due to ongoing re-architecture efforts this API might not return all file versions for this policy ID. Instead, this API will only return file versions held in the legacy architecture. Two new endpoints will available to request any file versions held in the new architecture. For file versions held in the new architecture, the `GET /legal_hold_policy_assignments/:id/file_versions_on_hold` API can be used to return all past file versions available for this policy assignment, and the `GET /legal_hold_policy_assignments/:id/files_on_hold` API can be used to return any current (latest) versions of a file under legal hold. The `GET /legal_hold_policy_assignments?policy_id={id}` API can be used to find a list of policy assignments for a given policy ID. Once the re-architecture is completed this API will be deprecated. This operation makes an HTTP GET request to the /file_version_legal_holds endpoint

| fields a| Array of String |  A comma-separated list of attributes to include in the response. This can be used to request fields that are not normally returned in a standard response. Be aware that specifying this parameter will have the effect that none of the standard fields are returned in the response unless explicitly specified, instead only fields for the mini representation are returned, additional to the fields requested. Additionally this field can be used to query any metadata applied to the file by specifying the `metadata` field as well as the scope and key of the template to retrieve, for example `?field=metadata.enterprise_12345.contractTemplate`. |  | {nbsp}
| If none match a| String |  Ensures an item is only returned if it has changed. Pass in the item's last observed `etag` value into this header and the endpoint will fail with a `304 Not Modified` if the item has not changed since. |  | {nbsp}
| boxapi a| String |  The URL, and optional password, for the shared link of this item. This header can be used to access items that have not been explicitly shared with a user. Use the format `shared_link=[link]` or if a password is required then use `shared_link=[link]&amp;shared_link_password=[password]`. This header can be used on the file or folder shared, as well as on any files or folders nested within the item. |  | {nbsp}
| X rep hints a| String |  A header required to request specific `representations` of a file. Use this in combination with the `fields` query parameter to request a specific file representation. The general format for these representations is `X-Rep-Hints: [...]` where `[...]` is one or many hints in the format `[fileType?query]`. For example, to request a `png` representation in `32x32` as well as `94x94` pixel dimensions provide the following hints. `X-Rep-Hints: [jpg?dimensions=32x32][jpg?dimensions=94x94]` Additionally, a `text` representation is available for all document file types in Box using the `[extracted_text]` representation. `X-Rep-Hints: [extracted_text]` |  | *x*{nbsp}

[[GetOptionsEvents]]
== Get events long poll endpoint
`<box:get-options-events>`


Returns a list of real-time servers that can be used for long-polling updates to the [event stream](#get-events). Long polling is the concept where a HTTP request is kept open until the server sends a response, then repeating the process over and over to receive updated responses. Long polling the event stream can only be used for user events, not for enterprise events. To use long polling, first use this endpoint to retrieve a list of long poll URLs. Next, make a long poll request to any of the provided URLs. When an event occurs in monitored account a response with the value `new_change` will be sent. The response contains no other details as it only serves as a prompt to take further action such as sending a request to the [events endpoint](#get-events) with the last known `stream_position`. After the server sends this response it closes the connection. You must now repeat the long poll process to begin listening for events again. If no events occur for a while and the connection times out you will receive a response with the value `reconnect`. When you receive this response youÃ¢Â€Â™ll make another call to this endpoint to restart the process. If you receive no events in `retry_timeout` seconds then you will need to make another request to the real-time server (one of the URLs in the response for this endpoint). This might be necessary due to network errors. Finally, if you receive a `max_retries` error when making a request to the real-time server, you should start over by making a call to this endpoint first. This operation makes an HTTP OPTIONS request to the /events endpoint

[[GetSearch]]
== Search for content
`<box:get-search>`


Searches for files, folders, web links, and shared files across the users content or across the entire enterprise. This operation makes an HTTP GET request to the /search endpoint


=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Configuration | String | The name of the configuration to use. | | *x*{nbsp}
| query a| String |  The string to search for. This query is matched against item names, descriptions, text content of files, and various other fields of the different item types. This parameter supports a variety of operators to further refine the results returns. * `""` - by wrapping a query in double quotes only exact matches are returned by the API. Exact searches do not return search matches based on specific character sequences. Instead, they return matches based on phrases, that is, word sequences. For example: A search for `"Blue-Box"` may return search results including the sequence `"blue.box"`, `"Blue Box"`, and `"Blue-Box"`; any item containing the words `Blue` and `Box` consecutively, in the order specified. * `AND` - returns items that contain both the search terms. For example, a search for `marketing AND BoxWorks` returns items that have both `marketing` and `BoxWorks` within its text in any order. It does not return a result that only has `BoxWorks` in its text. * `OR` - returns items that contain either of the search terms. For example, a search for `marketing OR BoxWorks` returns a result that has either `marketing` or `BoxWorks` within its text. Using this operator is not necessary as we implicitly interpret multi-word queries as `OR` unless another supported boolean term is used. * `NOT` - returns items that do not contain the search term provided. For example, a search for `marketing AND NOT BoxWorks` returns a result that has only `marketing` within its text. Results containing `BoxWorks` are omitted. Please note that we do not support lower case (that is, `and`, `or`, and `not`) or mixed case (that is, `And`, `Or`, and `Not`) operators. This field is required unless the `mdfilters` parameter is defined. |  | {nbsp}
| scope a| Enumeration, one of:

** USER_CONTENT
** ENTERPRISE_CONTENT |  Limits the search results to either the files that the user has access to, or to files available to the entire enterprise. The scope defaults to `user_content`, which limits the search results to content that is available to the currently authenticated user. The `enterprise_content` can be requested by an admin through our support channels. Once this scope has been enabled for a user, it will allow that use to query for content across the entire enterprise and not only the content that they have access to. |  USER_CONTENT | {nbsp}
| File extensions a| Array of String |  Limits the search results to any files that match any of the provided file extensions. This list is a comma-separated list of file extensions without the dots. |  | {nbsp}
| Created at range a| Array of String |  Limits the search results to any items created within a given date range. Date ranges are defined as comma separated RFC3339 timestamps. If the the start date is omitted (`,2014-05-17T13:35:01-07:00`) anything created before the end date will be returned. If the end date is omitted (`2014-05-15T13:35:01-07:00,`) the current date will be used as the end date instead. |  | {nbsp}
| Updated at range a| Array of String |  Limits the search results to any items updated within a given date range. Date ranges are defined as comma separated RFC3339 timestamps. If the start date is omitted (`,2014-05-17T13:35:01-07:00`) anything updated before the end date will be returned. If the end date is omitted (`2014-05-15T13:35:01-07:00,`) the current date will be used as the end date instead. |  | {nbsp}
| Size range a| Array of Number |  Limits the search results to any items with a size within a given file size range. This applied to files and folders. Size ranges are defined as comma separated list of a lower and upper byte size limit (inclusive). The upper and lower bound can be omitted to create open ranges. |  | {nbsp}
| Owner user ids a| Array of String |  Limits the search results to any items that are owned by the given list of owners, defined as a list of comma separated user IDs. Please note that the items still need to be owned or shared with the currently authenticated user for them to show up in the search results. If the user does not have access to any files owned by any of the users an empty result set will be returned. To search across an entire enterprise, we recommend using the `enterprise_content` scope parameter which can be requested with our support team. |  | {nbsp}
| Ancestor folder ids a| Array of String |  Limits the search results to items within the given list of folders, defined as a comma separated lists of folder IDs. Search results will also include items within any subfolders of those ancestor folders. Please note that the folders still need to be owned or shared with the currently authenticated user. If the folder is not accessible by this user, or it does not exist, a `HTTP 404` error code will be returned instead. To search across an entire enterprise, we recommend using the `enterprise_content` scope parameter which can be requested with our support team. |  | {nbsp}
| Content types a| Array of Enumeration, one of:

** NAME
** DESCRIPTION
** FILE_CONTENT
** COMMENTS
** TAG |  Limits the search results to any items that match the search query for a specific part of the file, for example the file description. Content types are defined as a comma separated lists of Box recognized content types. The allowed content types are as follows. * `name` - The name of the item, as defined by its `name` field. * `description` - The description of the item, as defined by its `description` field. * `file_content` - The actual content of the file. * `comments` - The content of any of the comments on a file or folder. * `tag` - Any tags that are applied to an item, as defined by its `tag` field. |  | {nbsp}
| type a| Enumeration, one of:

** FILE
** FOLDER
** WEB_LINK |  Limits the search results to any items of this type. This parameter only takes one value. By default the API returns items that match any of these types. * `file` - Limits the search results to files * `folder` - Limits the search results to folders * `web_link` - Limits the search results to web links, also known as bookmarks |  | {nbsp}
| Trash content a| Enumeration, one of:

** NON_TRASHED_ONLY
** TRASHED_ONLY |  Determines if the search should look in the trash for items. By default, this API only returns search results for items not currently in the trash (`non_trashed_only`). * `trashed_only` - Only searches for items currently in the trash * `non_trashed_only` - Only searches for items currently not in the trash |  NON_TRASHED_ONLY | {nbsp}
| mdfilters a| Array of String |  Limits the search results to any items for which the metadata matches the provided filter. This parameter contains a list of 1 metadata template to filter the search results by. This list can currently only contain one entry, though this might be expanded in the future. This parameter is required unless the `query` parameter is provided. |  | {nbsp}
| sort a| Enumeration, one of:

** MODIFIED_AT
** RELEVANCE |  Defines the order in which search results are returned. This API defaults to returning items by relevance unless this parameter is explicitly specified. * `relevance` (default) returns the results sorted by relevance to the query search term. The relevance is based on the occurrence of the search term in the items name, description, content, and additional properties. * `modified_at` returns the results ordered in descending order by date at which the item was last modified. |  RELEVANCE | {nbsp}
| direction a| Enumeration, one of:

** DESC
** ASC |  Defines the direction in which search results are ordered. This API defaults to returning items in descending (`DESC`) order unless this parameter is explicitly specified. When results are sorted by `relevance` the ordering is locked to returning items in descending order of relevance, and this parameter is ignored. |  DESC | {nbsp}
| limit a| Number |  Defines the maximum number of items to return as part of a page of results. |  30 | {nbsp}
| Include recent shared links a| Boolean |  Defines whether the search results should include any items that the user recently accessed through a shared link. Please note that when this parameter has been set to true, the format of the response of this API changes to return a list of [Search Results with Shared Links](r://search_results_with_shared_links) |  false | {nbsp}
| fields a| Array of String |  A comma-separated list of attributes to include in the response. This can be used to request fields that are not normally returned in a standard response. Be aware that specifying this parameter will have the effect that none of the standard fields are returned in the response unless explicitly specified, instead only fields for the mini representation are returned, additional to the fields requested. |  | {nbsp}
| offset a| Number |  The offset of the item at which to begin the response. |  0 | {nbsp}
| Output Mime Type a| String |  The mime type of the payload that this operation outputs. |  | {nbsp}
| Config Ref a| ConfigurationProvider |  The name of the configuration to be used to execute this component |  | *x*{nbsp}

| User type a| Enumeration, one of:

** ALL
** MANAGED
** EXTERNAL |  Limits the results to the kind of user specified. * `all` returns every kind of user for whom the `login` or `name` partially matches the `filter_term`.

[[UpdateUsersFolders0ByUserId]]
== Transfer owned folders
`<box:update-users-folders0-by-user-id>`


Move all of the items (files, folders and workflows) owned by a user into another user's account Only the root folder (`0`) can be transferred. Folders can only be moved across users by users with administrative permissions. This call will be performed synchronously which might lead to a slow response when the source user has a large number of items in all of its folders. If the destination path has a metadata cascade policy attached to any of the parent folders, a metadata cascade operation will be kicked off asynchronously. There is currently no way to check for when this operation is finished. The destination folder's name will be in the format `{User}'s Files and Folders`, where `{User}` is the display name of the user. To make this API call your application will need to have the "Read and write all files and folders stored in Box" scope enabled. Please make sure the destination user has access to `Relay` or `Relay Lite`, and has access to the files and folders involved in the workflows being transferred. Admins will receive an email when the operation is completed. This operation makes an HTTP PUT request to the /users/{user_id}/folders/0 endpoint
